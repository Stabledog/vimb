<h1>Bookmark file format changed</h1> \
<p>The history file and bookmarks file will now holds also the page titles to serve them in the completion list. This will break previous bookmark files.</p> \
<p>The parts of the history and bookmark file are now separated by <b>\\t</b> char like the cookie file.</p> \
<code> \
// old format<br/> \
http://very-long.uri/path.html tag1 tag2<br/> \
http://very-long.uri/path-no-tags.html<br/> \
</code> \
<code> \
// new format<br/> \
http://very-long.uri/path.html<b>\\t</b>title of the page<b>\\t</b>tag1 tag2<br/> \
http://very-long.uri/path-no-title.html<b>\\t\\t</b>tag1 tag2<br/> \
http://very-long.uri/path-no-title-and-no-tags.html<br/> \
</code> \
<h2>What to do?</h2> \
<p> \
If you have no entries in you bookmark you must edit them to fit the new format. This can be done with following 'sed' command. </p> \
<p><b>Don't forget to backup the bookmark file before running the command.</b></p> \
<code> \
// replace the first space in earch line of file to <b>\\t\\t</b> if the line haven't already a \t in it.<br/> \
sed -i -e '/\\t/!{s/ /\\t\\t/}' bookmark<br/> \
</code> \
<p>If you had no entries in the bookmark file or you changed it successfully, you should remove the '#define SHOW_ANNOUNCEMENT' from <i>config.h</i> file and recompile vimb.</p> \
